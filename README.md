# Research Question

How does the increase in greenhouse gas concentration correlate with sea surface temperature and sea ice extent on the global scale?

# Summary of Analysis

To determine the correlation of greenhouse gas with other climate forcing, I will plot the global concentration and the annual growth rates of each major greenhouse gas, the mean SST anamolies (1960 - 2019), and the Sea Ice Extent (1979 - 2020). Then, I will analyze the overall patterns of each plot and use these patterns to identify the relationship between the increase in greenhouse gas with the SST anomaly and sea ice extent.
