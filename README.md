# An Analysis of the Effect of the Global Warming Potential Gases 


# Scientific Question
The comparison of the impact between high global warming potential gases and CO2
Which types of greenhouse gases contribute the most to global warming? 

# Dataset

Carbon Dioxide https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/data.html

Nitrous Oxide https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends_n2o/

Methane https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends_ch4/

Sulfur Hexafluoride: https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends_sf6/


# Summary of Analysis

In the analysis, I will plot and compare:
1) The concentration in timeseries and the annual growth rate of each greenhouse gas.
2) The global distribution of greenhouse gases.
3) The temperature increase associated with greenhouse gases.
