# An Analysis of the Effect of the Global Warming Potential Gases 


# Scientific Question
The comparison of the impact between high global warming potential gases and CO2
Which types of greenhouse gases contribute the most to global warming? 

# Dataset

Carbon Dioxide https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/data.html

Nitrous Oxide https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends_n2o/

Methane https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends_ch4/

Sulfur Hexafluoride: https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends_sf6/


# Summary of Analysis

In the analysis, I will plot and compare the concentration in the time series of greenhouse gases and their annual growth rates. Then, I will analyze their distribution and find a correlation with the increase in temperature. I also plan to show the change in sea level and ice loss, which correspond to the increase in global temperature. Finally, I will apply data analysis to this dataset for finding insights into the contribution of each greenhouse gas.

# Potential Plots in the Project:
1) The concentration in timeseries and the annual growth rate of each greenhouse gas.
2) The global distribution of greenhouse gases.
3) The temperature increase associated with greenhouse gases.
4) The change in sea level and ice loss.
